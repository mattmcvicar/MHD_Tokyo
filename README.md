"Yeah, I only like their earlier stuff..."

This hack will tell you how much your favourite band/artist sucks. Specifically, it will tell you when they started to suck. 

It's well known that as an artist begins to become popular, they start to change their sound, displeasing many of their original fanbase:

My plan is take an artist name as a query, and return the point at which they started selling out, with some kind of graphics showing the music feature evolution over time. I'll be using the EchoNest API to analyse the audio.

I am looking for a web developer! I might be able to hobble together a Flask app in python, but that's about the limit of my web dev skills. Please contact me if you want to make a shiny front-end with me!
